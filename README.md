# Python-Challenge
Two Python scripts: One analyzes a company's financial records(PyBank) and the other analyzes a local election data (PyPoll). I was able to utilize my knowledge of functions, data structures (lists and tuples) as well as List Comprehension, to achieve these analysis. The results of these analysis were also exported to an "analysis.txt" file. </br>

<b>PyBank-Challenge</b></br>
A Python script that analyzes the financial records from a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. This script analyzed the records and calculated the following:
1. The total number of months included in the dataset.
2. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
3. Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes.
4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
5. The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

<b>PyPoll-Challenge</b></br>
A Python script that analyzes a set of polling data called election_data.csv. This script analyzed the votes and calculated the following:
1. The total number of votes cast.
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. The percentage of votes each candidate won.
4. The total number of votes each candidate won.
5. The winner of the election based on popular vote.
